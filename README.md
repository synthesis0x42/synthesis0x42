hi, I conduct research in quantum computing miscellania. I am also 17 years old, in my last year of high school. feel free to email me at (either _ or akr-) (at) synthesis0x42.digital. conceptually, I am interested in artificial consciousness, divine simulacra, and rationality. you may define those things for yourself. side interests include e2e encryption, and *very occasionally* we do some dabbling in x86 assembly, not in the public eye. I like FOSS.

I am most active in a professional sense on Misskey forks, specifically on [@0x42@miruku.cafe](https://miruku.cafe/@0x42)! Come chat with me there.
