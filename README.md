Hey, I'm *butterflylaceration*. My real name's Akira, but you can call me whatever nickname you're able to come up with. I'm a Year 11 student, and my main research interest is in quantum information. There is nothing else particularly interesting about my character.

Contact me at akira.li146@gmail.com or ask me for my ProtonMail.
