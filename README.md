researcher and enthusiast in quantum software miscellania, main experience is in quantum control and characterisation (state estimation, quantum error) but interested in all elements of quantum information science! see public archives of code below.  

as for classical cs, vaguely into cybersec/encryption, machine learning, a little webdev. generally focused on quantum cs, so don't expect much in this regard. might look into getting back into informatics. affiliated with [@lumia0x64](https://github.com/lumia0x64) who mainly does ctfs.
